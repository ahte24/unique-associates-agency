				<p class="mb-4">
					This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the rules and procedures
					regarding cancellations and refunds for purchases made through our
					website.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Order Cancellation</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">
					You can cancel your order within [X hours/days] of placing it,
					provided that the order has not yet been processed or shipped. Once
					the order is processed or shipped, cancellation is no longer possible.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-4">
					To cancel your order, please contact us at [email protected] with your
					order details. We will confirm the cancellation and refund the payment
					if applicable.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Refund Policy</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">
					Refunds are only provided for products that are defective, damaged, or
					significantly different from what was ordered. If you wish to request
					a refund, please contact us within [X days] of receiving your product.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-4">
					We may request additional information, such as images of the defective
					or damaged item, to process your refund. Once approved, refunds will
					be processed within [X business days], and the amount will be credited
					to the original payment method used during purchase.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Non-Refundable Items</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">The following items are not eligible for a refund:</p>

				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
					<li>Digital products or services once delivered</li>
					<li>Gift cards or vouchers</li>
					<li>Items purchased on sale or as part of a promotion</li>
					<li>Any product that has been used or altered after delivery</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Late or Missing Refunds</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">
					If you haven&apos;t received a refund yet, first check your bank account or
					credit card statement again. Then contact your bank or credit card
					company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially
					posted.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-4">
					If you&apos;ve done all of this and still have not received your refund,
					please contact us at [email protected].

					policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Any changes will
					take effect immediately upon posting to this page.
